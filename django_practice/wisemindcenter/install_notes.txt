-----------------MYSQL problems on my local ubuntu laptop---------------------
--------my mac laptop could not install the same version of mysqlclient python module as the server 
    - had to use the

-------could not login to the mysql server as root, had to give the root user a password
    -> I had to follow some instructions on how to modify the mysql server root user provided here
    ( https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-20-04 )
    , then i was able to have django use the root user for its db connection
    
    - used the following commands to do so:
        -> sudo mysql
        -> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
        -> exit
        -> mysql -u root -p
        -> (don't do this or for some reason django can't connect with the root info, but by doing you can use sudo mysql ) ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH auth_socket;
